## User Task 1-7

Once you change from current user to the root user the id in the command terminal changes.
It goes from your user on the server to the root user's address. Useradd asks for no additional
instructions once creating the user. Whilst Adduser allows you to create a password and enter other
user information. Once the user is logged into Sally's account it changes the id in the terminal to Sally's 
id. When you try to create a User from Sally's id the system does not allow it because that user/id does not
have access to those level of commands.
